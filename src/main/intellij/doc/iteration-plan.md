We should definitely begin with writing the 'create profile' and 'dashboard' 
uses cases first, as without them none of the other features work. Then we 
should figure out how to log in/out, as that is key for security and is 
therefore a primary feature. Next we should work on searching 
profiles, as this is an integral step for recommending profiles, 
looking up relevant dashboards, and direct messaging.
