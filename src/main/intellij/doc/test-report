#Test Report
For our testing process, it was twofold. The first part 
involved creating 'fake' profiles that are pre-loaded
into the system (which you can find in the controller 
class). The second part of testing was interacting with 
these profiles, as well as creating and interacting 
with new ones creating locally and temporally, through 
the Text-Based interface. We would test commands in 
different orders in the UI, and view and change and 
view the fake and newly made profiles. We would 
recommend that the best way that you test the 
functionality is through the UI after looking at the 
details for the pre-written fake profiles. 

#Iteration 2 plan
On the second iteration we envision to implement the
'getRec()' method. This will implement an algorithm where
users can see other profiles the Schmoodle recommends they
connect with. Users will be matched by similar majors, classes
taken, and/or graduating classes. We also plan to implement 
dashboard PINs, where in order to edit a dashboard, a 4-digit
PIN is required before entry.
