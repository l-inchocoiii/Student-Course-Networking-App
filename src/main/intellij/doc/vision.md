#Project Description: 
We envision an application that promotes connections
between Vassar students and faculty based on
commonalities, such as campus interests, academic
information, and past-experiences. It also provides
a common platform for campus organizations to announce
and update their org-specific activities.

#Key Features Summary
- Ability to make a personal profile. 
- Publicly viewable dashboards that can be regularly updated. 
- Rating specific classes
- Can "DM" (Direct Message) other profiles. 
- Search for profiles or dashboards. 
- Can add "friends". 
- Can get a recommendation to connect with another profile.

#Business Case: 
Our application inhabits a niche that other products 
do not: 
- It is specifically tailored to Vassar, so commonalities 
are easier to identify for users. 
- It provides a common "bulletin board" for all Vassar 
students and faculty to keep up with announcements for 
relevant organizations and teams. 
  - Promotes connections between students and faculty 
  through a recommendation feature. 

#Goals Summary 
##User

##System
