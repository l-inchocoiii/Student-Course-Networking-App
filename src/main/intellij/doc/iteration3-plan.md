We should definitely begin with writing the 'get recommendation' 
use case first, as we were unfortunately able to implement them on this iteration. 
The unique functionality of the app will reveal itself in the get recommendation use case.
Then we should implement the 'validate pin' usecase, as that is key for having multiple users being
able to edit a dashboard, and therefore a primary feature. Then we should work on the 'add course' 
and the 'rate class' use cases. Once we have access to the Vassar course catalogue, we would be able
to have users selects classes they have taken. They could then rate the courses and also this would 
make the get recommendation functionality more precise. DMs continue to be a very big reach case,
maybe we will implement this if we have time.
